      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <div>
      <p>Welcome to the Data Structure and Algorithm Roadmap! This roadmap is designed to help you navigate the world of data structures and algorithms, which are essential topics in computer science and software development.</p>
    
      <p>Having a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code, solving complex problems, and excelling in technical interviews.</p>
    
      <p>In this roadmap, we will explore a wide range of data structures and algorithms, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. Each section provides an overview, key concepts, and suggested learning resources to help you on your learning journey. 
        There are so many websites to learn data structures topics. Here i give a small introduction of all the topics.
        you got the all the main topics here and then learn it. Practice the problems related to the topic in Leetcode, Geeksforgeeks etc. 
        Do Practice, Practice and Practice more.</p>

      <p class="sub-header">Learn a Programming Language</p>
      <p>Firstly, select a language of your choice, be it Java, C, C++, Python, or any other language of your choice. 
        Before learning how to code in that language you should learn about the building pieces of the language: the basic syntax, the data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, etc.</p>
      
      <p class="sub-header">Learn about Time and Space complexities</p>
      <p>The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently.Complexity is of two types:<br>
        <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.<br>
        <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code. 
        You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.</p>

        <h2>Data Structures</h2>
        <i>A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. 
            The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. 
            An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.</i>
      <article class="arti">
        <p class="sub-header">Array</p>
        <p class="matter">The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. 
          Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. Each array element has a corresponding index number. </p>

        <p class="matter">A string is also a type of array. It can be interpreted as an array of characters. But it has some special characteristics like the last character of a string is a null character to denote the end of the string. 
          Also, there are some unique operations, like concatenation which concatenates two strings into one.</p>

        <p class="matter">Linked list is a linear data structure. But Linked List is different from Array in its configuration. It is not allocated to contiguous memory locations. 
          Instead, each node of the linked list is allocated to some random memory space and the previous node maintains a pointer that points to this node. 
          So no direct memory access of any node is possible and it is also dynamic i.e., the size of the linked list can be adjusted at any time. </p>

            The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.</p>

        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <i>Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation. 
            To explain in simpler terms, it is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.</i>
          <article class="arti">
            <p class="sub-header">Searching Algorithm</p>
            <p class="matter">Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element in an array, string, linked list, or some other data structure. 
                The most common searching algorithms are:
                <br><strong>Linear Search -</strong> In this searching algorithm, we check for the element iteratively from one end to the other.
                <br><strong>Binary Search -</strong> In this type of searching algorithm, we break the data structure into two equal parts and try to decide in which half we need to find for the element. 
                <br><strong>Ternary Search -</strong> In this case, the array is divided into three parts, and based on the values at partitioning positions we decide the segment where we need to find the required element.</p>

          <article class="arti">
            <p class="sub-header">Sorting Algorithm</p>
            <p class="matter">Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.
                There are a lot of different types of sorting algorithms. Some widely used algorithms are:
                <br><b>Bubble Sort</b>
                <br><b>Selection Sort</b>
                <br><b>Insertion Sort</b>
                <br><b>Quick Sort</b>
                <br><b>Merge Sort</b></p>

          <article class="arti">
            <p class="sub-header">Greedy Algorithm</p>
            <p class="matter">This algorithm builds up the solution one piece at a time and chooses the next piece which gives the most obvious and immediate benefit i.e., which is the most optimal choice at that moment. 
              So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to the global solutions are best fit for Greedy.</p>

            <p class="sub-header">Recursion</p>

          <article class="arti">
            <p class="sub-header">Backtracking <img src="backtracking.png" alt="Backtracking" class="Backtracking-img"></p>
            <p class="matter">Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
                Backtracking algorithm is derived from the Recursion algorithm, with the option to revert if a recursive solution fails, i.e. in case a solution fails, the program traces back to the moment where it failed and builds on another solution. 
                So basically it tries out all the possible solutions and finds the correct one.</p>
            <p>Some important and most comoon problems are</p>

              <p class="sub-header">Dynamic Programming</p>
              <p class="matter">Another crucial algorithm is dynamic programming. Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion.
                Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
                The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.            </p>
